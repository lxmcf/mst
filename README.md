# MST (Meson Script Thing)

MST is a small script I use in various projects to make meson easier to work with using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) tasks and other things...

## Usage
```sh
./mst [...]
```

## Arguments

- **--clean | -c:** _Deletes the build folder completely_
- **--verbose | -v:** _Echo's all output from meson and ninja_
